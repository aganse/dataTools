----------------------------------------------------------------

The routines here provide tools to do basic statistics and
manipulations on X,Y data pairs, as well as a plotting class
that handles the DataSeries class.

The DataSeries class was originally written back before the
JSci package (and similar packages) had been finished/available;
nowadays one would use a package like that rather than rewrite
one.  The real purpose then of this package now is just legacy
use because my MultiRegressLines, RayDemo, and SpheRayDemo
codes depend on it.

Note the Makefile in this folder only runs javadoc and clean;
those other applications compile these source files and place
the source files in each of their own folders so they can jar
them up with the application.
